# CO2_Emission_Tracker_Analysis
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze global CO₂ emissions by country, sector, and year. Identified top emitters, visualized sector-wise contributions, and tracked emission trends to provide actionable environmental insights


## Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis using Power BI

# Overview

This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions across countries and sectors to identify key contributors, visualize emission trends, and highlight areas for potential intervention. Using Power BI, we developed an interactive dashboard that provides policymakers, researchers, and environmental analysts with actionable insights into emissions data.

# Key Objectives

 -- Understand which sectors (Energy, Industry, Transport, etc.) contribute the most to CO₂ emissions.

 --Compare emission levels by country to identify top emitters and low-carbon leaders.

 --Track historical trends in emissions to see whether global efforts are reducing carbon output.

 --Provide a visual, user-friendly dashboard to explore the data in real time.

# Data

 --Country

 --Sector (Energy, Transport, Industry, etc.)

 --CO₂_Emissions_Mt (Million tonnes of CO₂ emissions)

 --Year

# Dashboard Features

 --Filled Map Visualization: View CO₂ emissions by country using color intensity.

 --Bar Charts by Sector: Compare emissions contributions from different economic sectors.

 --Trend Analysis: Line charts to analyze year-over-year changes.

 --Filter Controls: Select country, sector, or year range to drill down into details.

# Insights

 --A small number of countries account for over 60% of global emissions.

 --Energy and Industry sectors remain the dominant contributors to CO₂ output.

 --Some regions show decreasing trends, indicating policy impact, while others are still rising.

 --Interactive dashboard helps visualize progress toward net-zero targets.

# Tools Used

 --Power BI – for dashboard creation and visualizations

 --Python (Pandas) – for cleaning and preparing raw data

 --DAX measures – for aggregations and calculations

# How to Use

 --Clone or download this repository.

 --Open the .pbix file using Power BI Desktop.

 --Interact with filters to explore CO₂ emissions by sector, country, or year.

# Future Improvements

 --Add predictive modeling to forecast future emissions.

 --Integrate live APIs for automatically updating CO₂ data.

 --Include comparison with renewable energy adoption rates.
